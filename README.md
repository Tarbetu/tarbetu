<p align="left">Another winter evening in Antalya. Antalya's cold isn't harsh—it doesn't snow—but it always makes you feel chilled. The air is humid, and the cold sticks to your skin, making you shiver. During pandemic times, the streets were full of police. While tourists wandered around freely, police with radios were determined to lock natives in their homes.<br><br>The motto was clear: "Life fits into home"<br><br>I thought to myself, "like hell it does." Because it doesn't fit. There was only panic on television, and the incompetent figures with their speeches -- none of them made me feel secure. I was living with my family, trapped 24/7 within four walls with the same faces. No matter how much you love them, it's tough. I was actually in Istanbul for university, used to living alone. To be able to stay alone, I was sitting in the coldest room of the house. Lights off, songs that all sounded the same in my ears, and in front of me, a wall with peeling paint... I needed something to keep me busy to avoid going crazy, to avoid falling into hysteria. Other than music, other than games, other than eating...<br><br>My eyes suddenly fell on the white computer on the desk: a piece of junk with a Pentium processor, Asus brand. 1366x768 resolution. The display always looked muddy. It had Linux installed. I was never spoiled with luxury—even if my family could buy me better, I always wanted the simplest computer. I would install Linux on it; I always found using Linux more aligned with my worldview. As soon as my eyes fell on the computer, the question that popped into my mind was: How does this thing actually work?<br><br>I turned on the computer and started tinkering. I knew some things, but there were thousands of things I didn't know—ten times more than what I did know. At that moment, I felt that this device was actually the black magic of the modern world. Whoever could master this could probably master who knows what else.<br><br>Maybe I thought I could do something new to understand this device. Since I had nothing to do, since all that was expected of me was to stay locked up at home until I died, then why wasn't I trying to understand this thing called a computer? Where should I start? I didn't know, but maybe learning programming would guide me, I thought...</p>
