# Hi! I'm Emrecan Şuşter.

I'm a backend programmer (with some frontend skills) from Turkey. I work in a startup which developing project based Ruby on Rails. People usually think I'm an extrovert person, but you might think of me as an unsocial, a weird person which just program for fun. I love to describe myself in this way. Yeah, I'm a wannabe of being asocial. Aren't they cool? 

The name “Tarbetu” is Estonian. I don't have any relation with Estonian people. I just watched a documentary about Tallinn and I loved the city. So, I chose an Estonian nickname for myself. It just means “The Unnecessary”. In the past, I was a bit depressive, and I was thinking that no one needs me. Today, I absolutely don't think like this, but I love this nickname. It's part of my personality.

As a programmer, [I love Ruby and her companion Rails](https://leftoversalad.com/c/015_programmingpeople/PP9.png). Sometimes I cheat her with Crystal Lang. And I have and hate-love relationship with Rust. (I like her, but she doesn't like me) I'm always eager to learn experimental languages, so maybe I would start new relationships with Elixir, Haskell, or Nim. 

As a computer nerd, I'm a fan of Linux and I live in terminal. Like other nerds, I use Vim. However, (I love to say “However”, so I must use it) I don't use Arch, Gentoo, or Void btw. Like a lot of “soydevs” like me, I use openSUSE Tumbleweed in my personal computer, Ubuntu in my business computer.

As a human, I studied Psychology at Üsküdar University and learned some stuff like Neurology and Psychoanalysis. I love Sci-Fi, and I have an unpublished sci-fi book in Turkish. (I “refactor” it, again.) I was publishing some fanzines before Corona breakdown. (Some kind of underground magazine)
